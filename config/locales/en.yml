          >> What is the application for asylum?
          You have the right to apply for asylum in France to obtain the refugee status.
          To obtain the refugee status you must be unable to return to your home country because you fear repercussion if you return to you country due to your race, religion, your nationality, your political opinion or the fact that you belong to a particular social group.
          The goal of the application is to explain what happened in your country and what obliged you to leave it and why you cannot return. You must explain in details (date, place, players) the important things that happened to you and what you felt faced with these issues, your fears.
      instructions: |

          1st step: You have to go to an initial reception association , in charge of accompanying you in your procedures. They will help you to fill in the form for the asylum application with your name and your family setting. They will take identity photos and will arrange for a meeting at the one-step service at the prefecture . They will give you a convocation to go to the single counter. You must go to this meeting.
          WARNING: YOU WILL NOT BE RECIVED AT THE PRFECTURE BEFORE YOU GET A MEETING TROUGH A PRE-ADMISSION ASSOCIATION
          2nd step: Your meeting at the one-step service will be held with agents of the French office for immigration and integration (“Office français pour l'immigration et l'intégration”, Ofii ) to register your asylum application. They will validate the information, take the imprints of your 10 fingers and you’ll get an individual interview on your journey to France. They will interrogate you on your personal situation (need of shelter).
          /!\ If your imprints have been taken in another country you will be sent back to said country to apply for asylum there (it’s the “Dublin procedure”).
                  Your application for asylum will be registered and you will receive an attestation of your demand of asylum valid for 1 month. /!\ Keep this attestation safely.
                  You will be directed towards a specialized structure that will help you find shelter and apply for asylum.
          3rd step: You have 21 days to fill in the application for asylum demand in French given by the prefecture. You must send by mail at the French Office of refugee and asylum applicant’s protection (“Office français de protection des réfugiés et des demandeurs d'asile, Ofpra ), by “registered mail with reception proof” (« recommandé avec accusé de réception »):

During that meeting, an OPFRA agent called “protection officer” will ask you to talk about your origins, to tell what happened in your country that lead to you departure and why you cannot go back, to determine if you fill in the criteria that define a refugee. The interview will take place with an interpreter from OPFRA if necessary. The interview is individual but it’s possible to be accompanied by an authorized third party.
          WARNING: You have to go to this meeting.
          The answer from OPFRA can take several months. This extended silence doesn’t mean that your demand was rejected. If OPFRA cannot make a decision within 6 months you will be informed by mail.

          >> If you asylum application is rejected, you will be able to contest this decision in front of the national court of asylum right (“Cour National du Droit d'Asile”, CNDA ) within 1 month.
